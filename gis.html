    <h2>GIS Projects</h2>
    <p class="note">
      These are a selection of GIS projects that I created throughout my time at Texas Christian University. 
      Most of these projects come from assignments in GIS classes, but two projects are from an internship 
      I had with Patagonia.
    </p>

    <p>
      From October 2024 to May 2025, I collaborated with Patagonia Publishing and faculty at TCU to design two interactive ArcGIS 
      StoryMaps based on <i>The Blue Plate: A Food Lover’s Guide to Climate Chaos</i> by Mark J. Easter and 
      <i>Into the Thaw</i> by Jon Waterman. We first read the books, then conducted research and found reliable 
      data to communicate the environmental and economic impacts of climate change. Using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, 
      I created custom maps and data visualizations to show regenerative agriculture, wildlife migration, and Arctic warming.

            Environmental storytelling focused on the Brooks Range, Arctic communities, 
            and changing wildlife patterns. For this project, we wanted to immerse the viewer in the Alaskan Arctic. 
            To do this, we combined spatial context, field narratives, audio clips, and curated visuals into one cohesive StoryMap.

    <h3>Esri Support Analyst Projects</h3>
<p>
  During summer 2024, I had the opportunity to intern with Esri Support Services. During the three-month internship, I had to create three
  individual projects. I presented each project to the respective Support Analyst team: ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Desktop, and ArcGIS
  Enterprise. It was a great learning opportunity to test new tools and concepts that I did not learn inside the classroom.
</p>

<p> Furthermore, when I started working full-time at Esri, the new hires had to create an onboarding project to present to all Esri Support
  Analysts. This was particularly a challenge because we tried to integrate all Esri software: Online, Pro, and Enterprise into
  one grand analysis. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, Esri Support Services deletes all of its ArcGIS Online content after 90 days, so none of these projects were saved.
    Read more about them below. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessibility Mapping Across the U.S. (ArcGIS Online)</strong> — Used Survey123 data and Business Analyst demographics to analyze accessibility perceptions in major U.S. cities. Performed spatial joins in ArcGIS Pro and built a StoryMap to visualize differences between perception and actual demographic indicators.</li>
  <li><strong>Hospital Network Analysis – Pennsylvania (ArcGIS Pro)</strong> — Modeled 5-, 10-, and 15-minute drive-time service areas for five cities. Completed route and closest facility analysis for Philadelphia hospitals and pediatric centers to evaluate emergency access and optimal paths.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Ship Tracking (ArcGIS Enterprise / GeoEvent Server)</strong> — Configured GeoEvent to ingest a live JSON feed of ship positions in the San Francisco Bay. Created automated alerts that triggered whenever a vessel crossed a virtual mid-bay boundary.</li>
  <li><strong>Site Suitability Analysis – Baltimore (Onboarding Team Project)</strong> — Worked with a team to evaluate potential locations for a shared workspace company. Used ArcGIS Pro, Business Analyst, and Dashboards to assess transit access, amenities, competitor proximity, flood risk, and crime patterns. Results were delivered through an ArcGIS Dashboards and StoryMaps Briefing.</li>
